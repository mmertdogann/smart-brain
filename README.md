This is the frontend part of the Face Recognition App. I made this project via watching of the [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/) course.

To run the project:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`

If you have a problem when installing or starting the project you can simply add `sudo` to your install or start command.
